# Resume generator

Using the "Hackmyresume" project (https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume), the JSON Resume initiative (https://jsonresume.org/) and themes from https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme (specifically the Kendall theme: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme-kendall) I build my resume. These are the files need for the build.
**Important:** This is my own personal resume, so it does not make much sense for other people to use this code other than for reference.

**Dependencies:**
Node.js / NPM
HackMyResume
Kendall theme (to install: sudo npm install jsonresume-theme-kendall)

**Instructions:**
By executing the script, the raw.json file will be validated, analyzed and resumes will be generated in the following formats:

 - JSON (compliant with the "FRESH" format)
 - YAML
 - PDF
 - HTML
 - TXT

# Resume generator

These are the files needed to create my own resume using LaTeX.

To compile run: lualatex cv.tex

I based all this in Christophe Roger's beautiful template: https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv

Which in turn is based in a template by Alessandro Plasmati.

I've made some changes to it, mainly some really simple and self-explanatory formatting changes, but I also added some sections: Certifications and Projects.

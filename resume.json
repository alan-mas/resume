Then, used that data to gain insights and displayed a dashboard using the Watson Analytics platform. This would replace the current outsourced solution while also adding value using only internal resources and tools. Accomplishments: A proof of concept that would replace the outsourced solution was completed in under two months, and a fully-working live demo was shown during the IBM Interconnect 2017 conference in Las Vegas."

        {
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In less than a month, our team built a proof of concept 
                    of a solution to the registration of attendees in 
                    conferences, while also providing mobile applications and 
                    an RFID tracking system used to identify the attendees' 
                    participation and movement around the event's venue.
                \item Used the captured data to gain insights and create a 
                    dashboard using the Watson Analytics platform.
                \item Created reports by cleaning and processing the raw data 
                    using Pandas and plotting with Matplotlib.
                \item A fully-working demo was presented to IBM's global 
                    leadership during the \textit{Interconnect} conference in 
                    Las Vegas.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item By using IBM's Watson, our team trained and configured 
                    speech recognition patterns along with questions and 
                    answers in order to program a set of humanoid robots who 
                    could understand and answer natural language questions 
                    about the conference.
                \item A fully-working demo was presented publicly during the 
                    \textit{World of Watson} conference in Las Vegas.

        {Hadoop Raspberry Pi Cluster}
        {IBM}
        {March 2016}
        {
            \begin{itemize}
                \item I researched, analyzed and built a prototype to 
                    demonstrate the feasibility of using Raspberries as an 
                    affordable cloud offering to entry-level clients.
                \item I built a fully-working 12-node Hadoop cluster with 
                    Raspberry Pies including setting up the environment in each 
                    node, testing it and presenting a demo to high management.
                \item Documented the entire process and published it on the 
                    \href{https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/building-a-hadoop-cluster-with-raspberry-pi/}
                    {\underline{IBM developerWorks site}}.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item By gathering and analyzing Google's travel data, I built 
                    a wrapper and notification system to inform me of 
                    affordable flights for destinations, prices and schedules I 
                    decided.
                \item Published all the code and documentation in 
                    \href{https://github.com/alanverdugo/QPX}{\underline{my
